Scoring
=========

The first component of scoring algorithm to address is the "score" value generated which is the primary evaluation provided and dictates where the users fall on the score board built into DATSR. The following equation shows exactly how this value is calculated.

[equation]


How did was this computation derived? We began with [**N**] common statistical methods for measuring error which were: [blank]. We then combined them through trial and error to make the following congregate statistic:

[equation with letters substituted in]


The individual components that make up this congregate value are common in the field of statistics. Their definitions (i.e. how to calculate them) is shown in the mathematical equations listed below:

[list of how to calculate individual components]

Beyond these statistics, our application also displays [blank] which is not included in the congregate "score" value, but still has its place in statistical reasoning and was therefore included along with the rest. This value is calculated using the following algorithm:
