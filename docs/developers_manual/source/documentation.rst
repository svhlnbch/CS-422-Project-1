Documentation Development Guide
=================================

Overview
----------

This section is intended to aid those who wish to contribute to the DATSR project's documentation. The documentation for this project can be found in the "docs" folder in the root directory.


What You Need to Start
-----------------------

Software Necessary
###################

To generate builds in the documentation folders, you must have Sphinx downloaded and the Read-The-Docs theme if you wish to create html versions. For more information check out these links to documentation for `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ and `Read The Docs <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ .

Proficiencies
#################

To add to the documentation a developer should be proficient in reStructuredText for modifying content, Sphinx for generating builds, and Python for configuring Sphinx. 


Possible Areas of Improvement
------------------------------

- More robust documentation of source code

	- Backend modules
	- Frontend modules

- Further documentation of frameworks used and how they have been implemented in DATSR


Best Practices
---------------

Developers should follow standards of reStructuredText as a style guide. They should keep section formatting consistent with existing docs. It is also important to test builds with Sphinx often and to not push anything that has Sphinx errors or warnings.
