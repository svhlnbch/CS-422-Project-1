Overview of The System
=======================


DATSR is first and foremost an online repository built with time series data in mind. This means our site goes beyond simple data storage by providing features specific to TS datasets such as hierarchical/set structures, automatic validation/testing set division, and metadata specific to TS data sets.


In addition to providing a repository for time series data, DATSR also has a built in system for testing predictions made on time series. The site allows you to upload their data to see the effectiveness of their predictions not just in the score reflected, but also by ranking you among everyone else who has submitted predictions for that specific data set.
