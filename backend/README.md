# DATSR Backend Source Directory


This folder contains the backend source code for DATSR. This component of the application has been implemented using Python along with several libraries, notably pandas and numpy. Flask is the backend framework we used to connect to the frontend and MongoDB is the database technology we used to house data for the application.
